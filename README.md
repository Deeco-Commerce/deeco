# deeco

Deeco is a project on a mission to democratize web3/crypto adoption by providing e-commerce platforms powered by various payments options - with the focus on crypto based payments.

Deeco is an amazing e-commerce solution that will take advantage of the many benefits of crypto and web3. It is an amazing app with payments to be powered directly by crypto tokens/coins.

The goal is a "mini Shopify + crypto-based payments" - and even more.

Deeco has a global scope - Thanks to the borderless power of cryptocurrency.

#### The project seeks to solve two(2) main problems.

1. The problem of limits - blockings and watchings: Limits set by financial institutions, can truly be advantageous, but these limits might sometimes be exploited to the disadvantage of the customers. Deeco is a project that removes all those blocking limits like credit card deposit and transfer limits. It provides the everyday e-commerce user with the power of so much freedom, transparency, and even security - if the smart contracts are well developed and audited.

2. The problem of public exclusion: Many folks out there, have probably only been hearing about cryptocurrency, blockchain and web3, but have never had a full experience or even a basic knowledge of the many awesome benefits of these innovations.Our intentional entrance into the web3 and the blockchain world, left us wowed at the many awesome super powers of web3 and blockchain technology. Being able to build a platform like deeco where public interaction can be easily enhanced, to bring more public inclusion from regular people on the streets, is truly a pleasure.
