# deeco

Deeco is a project on a mission to democratize web-3 adoption by providing e-commerce platforms with multiple payment channels - but with a main focus on Web3/Blockchain payments.

Think "Shopify + Crypto(web3/blockchain)" - and even more.

Amidst all it's different challenges, Web3 continues to struggle in it's strides for more acceptance and adoption. Deeco is a project that will take e-commerce to the next level - bringing cryptocurrency payments right to the corridors of every-day e-commerce users..

#### The project seeks to solve two(2) main problems.

1. The problem of limits - blockings and watchings: Limits set by financial institutions, can truly be advantageous, but these limits might sometimes be exploited to the disadvantage of the customers. Deeco is a project that removes all those blocking limits like credit card deposit and transfer limits. It provides the everyday e-commerce user with the power of so much freedom, transparency, and even security - if the smart contracts are well-developed and audited.

2. The problem of public exclusion: Many folks out there, have probably only been hearing about cryptocurrency, blockchain and web3, but have never had a full experience or even a basic knowledge of the many awesome benefits of these innovations.
   My intentional entrance into the web3 and the blockchain world, left me wowed at the many awesome superpowers of web3 and blockchain technology. Being able to build a platform like deeco where public interaction can be easily enhanced, to bring more public inclusion from regular people on the streets, is truly a pleasure.

## Build stack/technologies

> This repository consist of both the client/front-end and blockchain/smart contract aspects of the project.

Being a one man team in this hackathon made building deeco very challenging. It was an experience of a lifetime. "deeco" was built with so much 💝 by me(@Okpainmo) and the hackathon team at jobjo.co, below is a list of the main awesome technologies that I used.

1. NextJs/ReactJs

> Please note, that the deeco project is fully and superbly responsive. It fits extremely well on different screen sizes.

## Live site(stand-alone store POC) - The main project POC front-end not deployed yet.

> The project is hosted live. You can explore it via this link - https://deeco.vercel.app. Just take note to keep your metamask wallet handy.

> Please use a PC for the best experience.
